# aws-s3-bucket-and-flask

I was tasked to display the list of files and directories from AWS S3 bucket.

I logged into the AWS console and navigated to the S3 bucket I wanted to view.

I then wrote a python program to display the list of files and folders from S3 bucket. 

But I decided to make it as a webpage, so did the same with the FLASK.

A list of files and directories appeared in a new window.
